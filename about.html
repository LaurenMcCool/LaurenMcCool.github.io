    <i>Hi!</i>
    <p4> My name is Lauren McCool. I am a third year Bachelor of Education (Secondary) / Bachelor of Arts (Design Innovation and Technology) student at ACU. Currently I am training to become a high school TAS (Technology and Applied Studies) teacher. My subject specialisations are Textiles with a minor in Industrial Technologies, focusing on both timber and metalwork. I am passionate about design education and committed to fostering creativity, problem-solving, and hands-on skills in the next generation of learners.
My teaching philosophy centres around creating an inclusive and engaging classroom environment where students feel empowered to explore, take risks, and express their individuality through design. I aim to combine practical skills with design thinking to encourage critical reflection and innovation, preparing students for both industry pathways and lifelong learning.
