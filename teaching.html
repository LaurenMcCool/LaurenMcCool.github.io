            <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>My teaching philosophy focuses on meeting students' individual and unique learning needs to ensure every learner feels supported and valued. I believe in creating a classroom that balances structure and flexibility; where students know what is expected of them, but also have the space to think, reflect, and grow in ways that suit their learning style.</p>
            <p>I draw on both behavioural and cognitive behavioural approaches, which means I focus not only on clear expectations and routines, but also on helping students understand how they learn, manage their emotions, and build confidence in their abilities.</p>

                </div>
            <p>In practice, this means setting up a safe and predictable learning environment where students feel comfortable taking risks and being themselves. Structure gives students security, especially in hands-on subjects like TAS where safety is essential, but I also encourage them to reflect on their choices and learning so they can develop independence and resilience.</p>
            <p>I aim to use positive strategies that engage students, while giving them the tools to manage their focus, motivation, and relationships. By showing empathy, maintaining fair but firm boundaries, and creating a classroom culture built on respect, I can support students not just as learners, but as people developing their own sense of self.</p>

            <h2>Creating a Positive Learning Environment</h2>
            <p>As a teacher, I aim to create a classroom where every student feels safe, valued, and included. I feel that learning happens best when students are not stressed and feel supported, so I work to build a positive classroom culture that encourages respect, empathy, and collaboration.</p>
            <p>I strive to create a calming and welcoming atmosphere for all through the physical layout of the room, the way lessons are structured, atmospheric music or the tone I set in my interactions with students.</p>
            <p>This is an example of how I would like my classroom to feel</p>

            </audio>
            <p>When students feel comfortable, they are more open to engaging, taking risks, and working through challenges.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, my goal is to inspire a classroom culture where students feel safe to learn, motivated to grow, and confident in their abilities, knowing they have the support they need to succeed.</p>
